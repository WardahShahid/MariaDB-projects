# MariaDB-project
This is Simple Mariadb Learning project.
In the Project, I have created the database in Xampp and named it as test. The test database has a table users which stores the data of the user, which is an id, username and password, when the
user signs up.

The user can access the home only if they login or in case they are new on the site they'll need to sign up first and then login.
